========================

The r/Starcraft Event Tracker


(Lofty?) Goals
---

1. Showcase currently live (and very soon to be live) events with link
2. Showcase upcoming events
3. Show a simple calendar of events (on the wiki?)
4. Pull data from multiple sources
5. Export data into google calendar for others to use
6. Integrate into sidebar


Data Sources (expand me?)
---

1. Team Liquid calendar [link](http://www.teamliquid.net/calendar/2014/01/)


Language choices
---

* Python
  * The ATZ server is already ready to support it.
  * Reddit side of things is already written
  * Some of the twitch stuff have been written as well

* Language old event tracker was written in?
  * still unknown
  * would save work if it is almost up and running already
